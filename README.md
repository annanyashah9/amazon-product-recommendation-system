# amazon-product-recommendation-system

This project is an Amazon Product Recommendatio System, which leverages Machine Learing techniques to enhance user experience by suggesting relevant products based on customer interactions and preferences. This is done through ways such as collaborative and content-based filtering to generate personalized recommendations.

Features:
1. User-Based and Item-Based Collaborative Filtering
2. Content-Based Filtering
3. Model Evaluation using Precision, Recall, and RMSE,
4. Real World Data from Amazon Reviews
5. Hyperparameter Tuning of Learning Rate, Minimum Neighbors for Prediction, Similarity Metrics (Cosine, Pearson, MSD)

The Amazon dataset contains information such as:
1. User ID
2. Product ID
3. Ratings
4. Product Reviews

This was the methodology that was employed:
1. Data Preprocessing - handling missing values, data normalization, feature engineering
2. Building different recommendation systems: Rank-based, Item-Item Similarity, User-User Similarity, Model-Based Collaborative Filtering
3. Model Evaluation - Precision, Recall, RMSE, F1 Score

Attached as part of the repo is the Jupyter Notebook, which contains the code used to analyze the dataset, along with insights and observations of the results generated.
